                            The “third wind” is something I experience while playing sports. I think most of us at least know that a
                            “second wind” refers to finding a burst of energy again, after you’ve already keeled over and questioned
                            your own mortality.You might not actually move faster or jump higher or do anything
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            better at all, but you definitely feel better like you’re young again. But, inevitably, that vat of energy
                            dissipates as well. The “third wind,” then, is when I enter a state where my body is accustomed to being
                            tired. I feel like I can move at that speed forever. I think “Yes, this is the new normal.” quite a sinking
                            feeling when your team loses — if it’s a 60 minute game, then you’ve been braced for that reality for at
                            least the past thirty minutes. It is more of a hunger, where you yearn to dive right back into it so that it
                            might eventually carve out a different ending for you.
