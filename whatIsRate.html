                <h1>What is Rate?</h1> 
                <p class="daniText"> <img src="img/HowToPlay1.png" class="leftImage"> Greetings, adventurer! What      have you come to seek in this forsaken land?          Knowledge,
                    power, wealth or something more? No matter, no matterâ€¦ Because here, in the realm of Rate you can
                    achieve anything - if you are willing to work hard enough to seize what you desire. Go on your own
                    adventure and defeat wild beasts, powerful demons or cunning warlocks all with your wits and skills.
                    Acquire new equipment, level up your abilities and become the greatest hero that this land has ever known!
                </p>
                <h2>Crush your enemies</h2>
                <p class="daniText">
                    But before you go venturing, traveler, remember to be wary for there is no place safe in the wretched world of Rate! You'll need to fight numerous enemies if you want to survive and achieve eternal glory in the hall of heroes. How you will do it's only up to you to decide... Some choose the path of wisdom and logic alone, others the path of strength and might and some, born cunning and witty, choose the way of the silent thief lurking in the night while stalking his prey.
                    <br>
                    But regardless of which direction you'll go one thing is certain - you will need to be knowledgeable and strategical in all of your battles, unless you are willing to suffer a most painful death.
